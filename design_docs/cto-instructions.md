As the CTO, after considering the Project Manager's recommendations and the additional context about the Marketing team's needs, here are the refined instructions for the architect to finalize the executive summary:

Instructions for the Architect
1. Focus on Marketing Autonomy
The primary goal of the MVP is to empower the Marketing team to autonomously prototype and test campaign ideas without relying on the Design or Engineering teams.
Ensure the workflow and tools are intuitive for non-technical users, with clear guidance and robust guardrails to prevent errors.
2. Simplify the Agent Architecture
Consolidate agents where possible to reduce complexity and development overhead:
Combine the Design Generation Agent and Design Evaluation Agent into a single "Design Optimization Agent" that generates 1â€“2 options per modification and evaluates them.
Documentation and validation can be semi-automated, with outputs tailored for Marketing's needs (e.g., simple before/after comparisons, clear instructions for Design/Engineering handoff).
3. Prioritize Key Features for the MVP
Focus on the following core features:
Scraping and rendering websites locally.
Allowing Marketing to make basic modifications and preview changes in real-time.
Providing undo/redo or rollback functionality to ensure safe experimentation.
Automated checks for accessibility and responsiveness to validate campaign ideas.
Defer advanced features like multi-option generation, full automation of documentation, and complex orchestration to later phases.
4. Optimize the Technology Stack
Use cost-effective and simple tools for the MVP:
Consider open-source alternatives to expensive AI APIs (e.g., fine-tuned in-house models).
Use a lightweight local server (e.g., http-server) instead of BrowserSync for initial development.
Ensure the stack is scalable but avoid over-engineering for the MVP.
5. Build for Non-Technical Users
Design the UI and workflows with Marketing in mind:
Include in-app guidance, tooltips, and clear error messages.
Provide a feedback loop for Marketing to report issues or request features.
Ensure prototypes are clearly marked as "not production" to avoid accidental publication.
6. Plan for Training and Support
Include resources for onboarding the Marketing team, such as tutorials, documentation, and initial training sessions.
Provide ongoing support to address any issues or questions as the team begins using the tool.
7. Collect Feedback and Iterate
Instrument the MVP to collect usage data and feedback from Marketing.
Use this data to refine workflows, prioritize features, and demonstrate the tool's value to the board and CEO.
8. Mitigate Risks
Implement strong guardrails to prevent Marketing from making changes that could break the site or violate compliance (e.g., respect robots.txt and terms of service).
Ensure all changes are reversible and prototypes are isolated from production environments.
Key Adjustments to the Executive Summary
Update the "Agent Architecture" section to reflect the consolidated agents and simplified workflows.
Refine the "Workflow Orchestration" section to emphasize Marketing's autonomy and the MVP's focus on rapid prototyping and safe experimentation.
Adjust the "Technology Stack" section to prioritize cost-effective and lightweight tools for the MVP.
Highlight the importance of user-centric design and training in the "Best Practices Integration" section.
Add a note in the "Risk Mitigation" section about isolating prototypes from production and ensuring compliance with legal and technical standards.
Final Note
The architect should ensure the executive summary reflects these priorities and adjustments, presenting a clear, practical, and cost-effective plan that aligns with the company's goals and the Marketing team's needs. This will position the project for success and demonstrate its value to the board and CEO.
