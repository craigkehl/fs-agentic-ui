Prompt:
    > "You are a skilled senior architect and frontend software engineer.Your current project is to document and describe the strategy to systematically create an 
      agentic workflow that can 1. scrape the html and css from a given URL 2. use LiveServer or some equivilent application to render the site locally from the 
      scraped code 3. Accept input from the user about how they would like the site altered. 4. Generate alterations based on the user input. 5. Render the 
      alterations for the user to interact with to confirm the result is what they intend. 6. document the changes such that a web developer can implement the 
      changes. Your agentic workflow should implement specialized agents for each task. Factor best practice work flow design such as Generative Agents could 
      attempt to design code for three different solutions for their given tasks and another agent could scroutinize or select the best code design before 
      implementing it. Agents could also ask additional questions of the user to understand the intent of the change. Consider existing tools we could implement to
      accomplish tasks or if better, ones we could create. Consider handoffs. Pause to ask relevavnt questions if needed. Today is July 1st 2025. Consider current
      patterns. Again, do not code. Only create and document the strategy which we can use to then create the code step by step. You are highly skilled and 
      focused to derive practical and reliable results."

⏺ I'll create a comprehensive strategy for building an agentic workflow system that can scrape, modify, and iterate on web designs. Let me start by planning
  this documentation task.
