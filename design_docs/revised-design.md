  - __Time Target__: Under 2 minutes
  - __User Experience__: Progress bar, clear status updates, automatic error recovery
  - __Guardrails__: Compliance validation, site complexity warnings

  ### Phase 2: Safe Experimentation (Autonomous Prototyping)
  Marketing Ideas → Natural Language Input → Design Optimization Agent → A/B Preview Options → Marketing Selection & Iteration
  - __Time Target__: 5-10 minutes per modification cycle
  - __User Experience__: Drag-and-drop interface, live preview, instant undo/redo
  - __Guardrails__: Change impact warnings, rollback safety, "prototype" watermarking

  ### Phase 3: Team Handoff (Automated Documentation)

  Approved Prototype → Documentation Agent → Design/Engineering Package → Stakeholder Review
  
  - __Time Target__: Under 1 minute for documentation generation
  - __User Experience__: One-click export, automated change summaries
  - __Guardrails__: Clear prototype-to-production disclaimers
