  - Marketing-Focused Capabilities:
    - Generate simple before/after visual documentation
    - Create plain-English implementation instructions
    - Export prototype specifications for Design/Engineering teams
    - Track and summarize all changes made during prototype session
  - Output: Developer-ready handoff package with Marketing context

  ## Marketing-Centric Workflow Orchestration

  Simplified 3-Phase Process

  ### Phase 1: Quick Setup (Self-Service)
  Marketing Team → Paste URL → Web Acquisition Agent → Ready-to-Edit Preview
  - Time Target: Under 2 minutes
  - User Experience: Progress bar, clear status updates, automatic error recovery
  - Guardrails: Compliance validation, site complexity warnings

  ### Phase 2: Safe Experimentation (Autonomous Prototyping)
  Marketing Ideas → Natural Language Input → Design Optimization Agent → A/B Preview Options → Marketing Selection & Iteration
  - Time Target: 5-10 minutes per modification cycle
  - User Experience: Drag-and-drop interface, live preview, instant undo/redo
  - Guardrails: Change impact warnings, rollback safety, "prototype" watermarking

  ### Phase 3: Team Handoff (Automated Documentation)
  Approved Prototype → Documentation Agent → Design/Engineering Package → Stakeholder Review
  - Time Target: Under 1 minute for documentation generation
  - User Experience: One-click export, automated change summaries
  - Guardrails: Clear prototype-to-production disclaimers
